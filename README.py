# Help Guide for IP Address Checker

Welcome to the IP Address Checker! This program allows you to gather information about IP addresses and domains. Below you will find instructions on how to use each feature of the program.

## Menu Options

1. **Check IP Info**
   - Enter an IP address to retrieve information such as the city, location coordinates, country, organization, timezone, VPN status, phone, and postal code.
   - Make sure you enter a valid IP address in the format `x.x.x.x`.

2. **Show Domain IP**
   - Enter a domain name (e.g., `example.com`) to get its corresponding IP address.
   - Ensure that the domain is valid and correctly formatted.

3. **Check IP Blacklist Status**
   - You will be prompted to check if the IP address is blacklisted.
   - If you confirm, the program will open a new browser window with the `ipvoid.com` website to check the blacklist status.
   - Make sure you have a stable internet connection.

4. **Show Address on Google Maps**
   - This option requires that you first check IP info (Option 1).
   - If location data is available, the program will generate a Google Maps URL based on the coordinates retrieved.
